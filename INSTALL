Phase 1: Preparation (The SD Card)
1. Gather Required Items
  MicroSD Card: At least 16GB (32GB or more is recommended).
  Computer: A Windows, macOS, or Linux machine to perform the flashing.
  MicroSD Card Reader: To connect the card to your computer.
  Raspberry Pi Imager Software: The official tool for installing the OS.
2. Download and Install Raspberry Pi Imager
  Go to the official Raspberry Pi website and download the Raspberry Pi Imager software for your computer's operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and install it.
3. Choose the OS and Device
  Launch the Raspberry Pi Imager software.
  Click "CHOOSE DEVICE" and select "Raspberry Pi 5".
  Click "CHOOSE OS" and select "Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)". Since your smart mirror project uses Chromium Kiosk mode, select the version with Desktop Environment (e.g., "Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) (with Desktop)").
4. Configure OS Settings (Optional but Recommended)
  Click the gear icon (settings) in the bottom right. This allows you to pre-configure system settings. It's helpful to enable SSH and set a username/password now, although for a smart mirror, the most critical step is setting the hostname and Wi-Fi.
  Set Hostname: (e.g., smartmirror).
  Set Username and Password: (e.g., pi and your password).
  Configure Wi-Fi: Enter your network name (SSID) and password.
  Set Locale settings: Select your keyboard layout and timezone.
  Click SAVE.
5. Flash the SD Card
  Click "CHOOSE STORAGE" and select your MicroSD card from the list. CAUTION: Double-check you select the correct drive, as this step will erase all data on it.
  Click "WRITE".
  The Imager will download the OS, flash it to the SD card, and verify the write process. This may take several minutes.
  Once complete, the Imager will notify you that you can remove the SD card.

🔌 Phase 2: Connecting and Initial Boot
1. Connect Hardware
  Insert the MicroSD Card: Carefully insert the newly flashed MicroSD card into the MicroSD slot on your Raspberry Pi 5.
  Connect the DSI Display: Since your project uses a DSI display, connect the ribbon cable from the display to the appropriate DSI connector on the Raspberry Pi 5 board. Ensure the cable is properly seated and the   locking mechanism is secured.
  Connect Peripherals (Optional): If you didn't pre-configure Wi-Fi, you may need to temporarily connect a keyboard and mouse (via USB).
  Connect Power: Plug the official USB-C power supply (required for Pi 5) into the power port.
2. Initial Boot
  As soon as power is connected, the Raspberry Pi 5 will automatically power on.
  The screen should light up, and you will see the boot sequence loading.
  The Raspberry Pi OS Desktop environment will load after the boot process is complete.
  If you set up an account in the Imager, the screen will either go straight to the desktop or prompt you to log in with the username/password you chose.
  The Raspberry Pi is now successfully booted to the desktop, providing the necessary graphical environment (the GUI) to run your custom Chromium Kiosk smart mirror application.
