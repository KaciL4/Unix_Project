# Unix_Project - Smart Mirror 🪞

Smart Mirror is a hidden screen placed behind a two-way mirror. Powered by a Raspberry Pi, the screen displays real-time information such as the date, the time, the weather, and a quote of the day, all visible through the mirror's surface.

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to construct a fully functional, open-source Smart Mirror using a Raspberry Pi. This project's main objective is to transform a standard mirror into a interactive digital system that provides essential, real-time informations visible at a glance in the mirror, making the morning routine more efficient and informative.
