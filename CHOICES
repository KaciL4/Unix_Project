# Choosing a platform

We chose to use a Raspberry Pi instead of a Virtual Machine because it's more efficient, uses less power, and it makes the project feel like a real embedded system. 
Although a Virtual Machine is easier to test and fast to reset it something breaks, a Raspberry Pi is more realistic for a physical smart mirror.

# Distribution Options

We picked Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop since it gives us a GUI for debugging the display and Chromium kiosk is easier to configure.
Pi OS Lite is lightweght but it would require more manual setup.

# Autostart Method

We chose to use a systemd service since .bashrc only works after login, so it's not reliable, amd cron doesn't restart on crash. 
A systemd is cleaner, it handles auto-restart, and logs errors. so it's the most professional and stable way.

# Display Software

We're planning to use a Python script that will generate a local HTML page displayed in Chromium Kiosk mode. 
This gives us full control, and Kiosk mode is easy to autostart. We will also use JavaScript to dynamically update the interface with the data fetched from the backend.

# Task Automating

For automations, we are using bash for system tasks, and Python for logic. 
Tasks like updates and cleanup are easier in bash, while others lie APIs, time, weather, are easier in Python.

# Scheduling

We're using cron because it's simple and fits our case (e.g., refresh weather every hour).
